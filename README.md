# AssignmentScheduler
This is an application that lets you CRUD (create, read, update and delete) students, assignments and student schedules.
I developed this using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, EJS and bootstrap for the appearance, all this is connected to a MongoDB database which consists of 3 schemas,
a student schema (which stores the students), an assignment schema (which stores the assignments) and a report schema 
( which stores the combined attributes of a student and an assignment to create a student schedule). 
Where each data entry has an extensive amount of validation to ensure correct data.
